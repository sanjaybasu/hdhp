      <txt><![CDATA[PSUPLD is the pooled variance primary sampling unit variable that represents the impact of the sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use PSUPLD instead of the annual primary sampling unit (PSUANN) if the years included in a pooled analysis include survey year 2001 or earlier. When pooling data from only 2002 and later, use the variable PSUANN, the annual stratum variable for each survey year.

For analysis, researchers need to use PSUPLD in conjunction with STRATAPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data. 


PSUPLD should be used when analysts wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled. The use of PSUPLD and STRAPLD is necessary to obtain appropriate standard errors by specifying a common variance structure.

      <txt><![CDATA[PERWEIGHT is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable based on the Final Person Weight in the original MEPS annual full-year consolidated files.  This weight should be used for many cross-sectional analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. 

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly when analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire or the Diabetes Care Survey, or when conducting longitudinal analyses with the MEPS data. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire from 2000 forward should use SAQWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.]]></txt>

Date of birth and age were asked for each reporting unit member, and then exact age was calculated from date of birth. Where the calculated age and the age provided did not match, inconsistencies were reviewed and resolved. When date of birth was not provided, but age was provided, the month and year of birth were assigned randomly from among the possible valid options. For any cases still not accounted, age was imputed using:
(1) the mean age difference between MEPS participants with certain family relationships (where available) or  
(2) the mean age value for MEPS participants.

Single persons who do not live with a relative nor a person identified as a "significant other" are assigned a family size of one.

      <txt><![CDATA[FTOTVAL reports the total income for each person's CPS family.

Beginning in 2007, FAMINC was constructed from the person-level total income variable (INCTOT).

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

FTOTVAL was derived by constructing person-level total income comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. Person-level income totals were then summed over family members, as defined by CPSFAMID, to yield CPS family-level total income.

Two additional family income variables were created by IPUMS MEPS. FTOTINCCPS is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for CPS families (excludes foster children and unmarried partners).  FTOTINCMEPS is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). Both FTOTINCCPS and FTOTINCMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income)]]></txt>

Beginning in Panel 12, ARTHGLUPEV was included as a Priority Condition in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section. The PE section was asked in its entirety in Round 1 for all current or institutionalized persons, and in Rounds 2 and 4 for only new reporting unit members. In Rounds 3 and 5, the specific condition questions (except joint pain and chronic bronchitis) were asked only if the person had not reported the condition in a previous round; the joint pain and chronic bronchitis questions were asked in Rounds 3 and 5 for all current or institutionalized persons aged 18 or older, regardless of Round 1, Round 2, and Round 4 responses. The conditions included in the PE section are:
High blood pressure, including multiple diagnoses 
Heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and other unspecified heart disease) 
Stroke 
Emphysema 
Chronic Bronchitis 
High cholesterol, including the age of diagnosis 
Cancer 
Diabetes 
Joint pain 
Arthritis 
Asthma 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD)   
These conditions were selected because of their relatively high prevalence, and because generally accepted standards for appropriate clinical care have been developed.

Beginning with Panel 12, condition data were collected at the person-by-round level (indicating if the person was ever diagnosed with the condition) and at the condition level. If the person reported having been diagnosed with a condition, the person-by-round variable was set to '1' (Yes) and a condition record for that medical condition was created.

Beginning in Panel 12, CANCEREV was included as a Priority Condition in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section. The PE section was asked in its entirety in Round 1 for all current or institutionalized persons, and in Rounds 2 and 4 for only new reporting unit members. In Rounds 3 and 5, the specific condition questions (except joint pain and chronic bronchitis) were asked only if the person had not reported the condition in a previous round; the joint pain and chronic bronchitis questions were asked in Rounds 3 and 5 for all current or institutionalized persons aged 18 or older, regardless of Round 1, Round 2, and Round 4 responses. The conditions included in the PE section are:
â¢	High blood pressure, including multiple diagnoses 
â¢	Heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and other unspecified heart disease) 
â¢	Stroke 
â¢	Emphysema 
â¢	Chronic Bronchitis 
â¢	High cholesterol, including the age of diagnosis 
â¢	Cancer 
â¢	Diabetes 
â¢	Joint pain 
â¢	Arthritis 
â¢	Asthma 
â¢	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD)   
These conditions were selected because of their relatively high prevalence, and because generally accepted standards for appropriate clinical care have been developed.

Beginning with Panel 12, condition data were collected at the person-by-round level (indicating if the person was ever diagnosed with the condition) and at the condition level. If the person reported having been diagnosed with a condition, the person-by-round variable was set to '1' (Yes) and a condition record for that medical condition was created.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons not reported to have any private health insurance coverage during the year, EXPOPRPAY captures the sum of direct payments made by other private insurance source for care provided during the year. Payments for over-the-counter drugs and indirect payments not related to specific medical events, such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share and Medicare Direct Medical Education subsidies, are not included in this amount. 

AHRQ staff advise users to exercise caution when interpreting the expenditures recorded in EXPOPRPAY. While these payments stem from apparent inconsistent responses to the health insurance and source of payment questions in the survey, some of these inconsistencies may have logical explanations. For example, private insurance coverage in MEPS is defined as having a major medical plan covering hospital and physician services. If a MEPS sample person did not have such coverage but had a single service type insurance plan (e.g., dental insurance) that paid for a particular episode of care, those payments may be classified as "other private."

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, OPEXPOPR captures the sum of direct payments made by other private insurance source for outpatient care provided during the year. This includes payments for hospital facility expenses (including direct hospital care, including room and board, diagnostic and laboratory work, x-rays, and similar charges, as well as any physician services included in the hospital charge) and "separately billing doctor" or SBD expenses (including services provided to patients in hospital settings by providers like radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists, whose charges are often not included in hospital bills).

AHRQ staff advise users to exercise caution when interpreting the expenditures recorded in OPEXPOPR. While these payments stem from apparent inconsistent responses to the health insurance and source of payment questions in the survey, some of these inconsistencies may have logical explanations. For example, private insurance coverage in MEPS is defined as having a major medical plan covering hospital and physician services. If a MEPS sample person did not have such coverage but had a single service type insurance plan (e.g., dental insurance) that paid for a particular episode of care, those payments may be classified as "other private."

Note that hospitals usually include expenses associated with emergency room visits that immediately result in an inpatient stay with the charges and payments for the inpatient stay. Therefore, to avoid the potential for double counting when imputing missing expenses, separately reported facility expenditures for emergency room visits that were identified in the Medical Provider Component (MPC) as directly linked to an inpatient stay were included as part of the inpatient stay only (see HPCHGTOT and HPFCHT). This strategy to avoid double counting resulted in $0 facility expenditures for these emergency room visits (but there still may be associated separately-billing doctor expenses). However, these $0 emergency room visits are still counted as separate visits in the utilization variable ERTOTVIS.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, EREXPOF captures the sum of direct payments made by other Federal government sources for care provided by emergency room medical providers, including Indian Health Service, military treatment facilities, and other care provided by the Federal government. This includes payments for hospital facility expenses (including direct hospital care, including room and board, diagnostic and laboratory work, x-rays, and similar charges, as well as any physician services included in the hospital charge) and "separately billing doctor" or SBD expenses (including services provided to patients in hospital settings by providers like radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists, whose charges are often not included in hospital bills). Payments for over-the-counter drugs and indirect payments not related to specific medical events, such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share and Medicare Direct Medical Education subsidies, are not included in this amount. For more information on how MEPS collects expenditure data, please refer to our user note on medical expenditures [URL omitted from DDI.].


Note that hospitals usually include expenses associated with emergency room visits that immediately result in an inpatient stay with the charges and payments for the inpatient stay. Therefore, to avoid the potential for double counting when imputing missing expenses, separately reported facility expenditures for emergency room visits that were identified in the Medical Provider Component (MPC) as directly linked to an inpatient stay were included as part of the inpatient stay only (see HPCHGTOT and HPFCHT). This strategy to avoid double counting resulted in $0 facility expenditures for these emergency room visits (but there still may be associated separately-billing doctor expenses). However, these $0 emergency room visits are still counted as separate visits in the utilization variable ERTOTVIS.

AHRQ staff advises users to exercise caution when interpreting the expenditures recorded in EREXPOPR. While these payments stem from apparent inconsistent responses to the health insurance and source of payment questions in the survey, some of these inconsistencies may have logical explanations. For example, private insurance coverage in MEPS is defined as having a major medical plan covering hospital and physician services. If a MEPS sample person did not have such coverage but had a single service type insurance plan (e.g., dental insurance) that paid for a particular episode of care, those payments may be classified as "other private."

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, ZNFEXPR captures the sum of direct payments made by private health insurance for hospital facility expenses associated with 'zero-night' inpatient hospital visits made during the year. Hospital facility expenses include direct hospital care, including room and board, diagnostic and laboratory work, x-rays, and similar expenses, as well as any physician services included in the hospital expense. Payments for over-the-counter drugs and indirect payments not related to specific medical events, such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share and Medicare Direct Medical Education subsidies, are not included in this amount.

Some analysts may prefer to exclude "zero-night stays" from inpatient analyses and/or count these stays as ambulatory visits. Therefore, a separate variable is provided that contains a count of the number of inpatient events where the reported dates of admission and discharge were the same (ZNTOTVIS). In addition, separate expenditure variables are provided for zero-night facility expenses (ZNFEXT) and for separately billing doctor expenses (ZNPREXT). Analysts who choose to exclude the zero-night stays from inpatient expenditure analyses need to subtract the zero-night expenditure variable from the corresponding expenditure variable for total inpatient stays.

AHRQ staff advises users to exercise caution when interpreting the expenditures recorded in ZNEXOPR. While these payments stem from apparent inconsistent responses to the health insurance and source of payment questions in the survey, some of these inconsistencies may have logical explanations. For example, private insurance coverage in MEPS is defined as having a major medical plan covering hospital and physician services. If a MEPS sample person did not have such coverage but had a single service type insurance plan (e.g., dental insurance) that paid for a particular episode of care, those payments may be classified as "other private."

AHRQ staff advises users to exercise caution when interpreting the expenditures recorded in RXEXPOPR. While these payments stem from apparent inconsistent responses to the health insurance and source of payment questions in the survey, some of these inconsistencies may have logical explanations. For example, private insurance coverage in MEPS is defined as having a major medical plan covering hospital and physician services. If a MEPS sample person did not have such coverage but had a single service type insurance plan (e.g., dental insurance) that paid for a particular episode of care, those payments may be classified as "other private."
