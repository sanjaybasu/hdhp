For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the section of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, 
race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 


Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.

      <txt><![CDATA[SUPP1WT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that harmonizes the sampling weights for a select subset of the supplements of the original NHIS public use files.  In this case, harmonization refers to putting weights from various years and source supplement files into a single, consistently named variable. 

The majority of weights included in SUPP1WT come from the supplement surveys for childhood immunization (years 1992-2003), smoking (1978-1980), family medical expenses (1975-1976), and AIDS knowledge and attitudes (1987-1995). In some cases, SUPP1WT represents a randomly selected person from a household; for example, a sample person age 18 and older was selected for the 1990 AIDS supplement. In other cases, the survey was also administered to all persons within a specific age group; for example, the 1998 childhood immunization supplement was administered to a sample child under 18 plus all children age 12-35 months. SUPP1WT represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

Beginning in 2011, the weights included in SUPP1WT are associated with variables from the Functioning and Disability supplement.

A sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.

Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

A similar flag variable, CSTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample child, that is, the one person under 18 per family who was selected at random for additional health-related questions, beginning in 1997, for families that included children.

      <labl>Occupation, 1995 basis</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[OCC1995 is a modified version of the 1995 revised Standard Occupational Classification-based codes (SOC), offering researchers a consistent long-term classification of occupations from 1969 to present. All original occupation information is stored in OCC. For more information on all of the occupational schemes that were used in previous NHIS surveys, please refer to the "User Note on Occupation and Industry Variables." [URL omitted from DDI.] Please see the "Universe" tab for more detailed information on changes in the universe across survey samples.

Occupation coding in NHIS surveys underwent its two biggest changes in 1983, when the NHIS switched from using the Classified Index of Occupation to using the 1977 SOC, and in 2004, after the 2000 SOC was released. The introduction of the 1977 SOC and the 2000 SOC contributed to significant discontinuities in occupation coding in the NHIS history. The IPUMS NHIS staff chose the 1995 revised SOC as the standard because it falls in-between the years when the 1977 SOC and the 2000 SOC were implemented in the NHIS.

The construction of OCC1995 is based on the work done by the IPUMS-USA [URL omitted from DDI.] project, which harmonized Census Bureau occupation classifications from 1950 to present, using the 1990 Census Bureau occupational classification scheme as a standard. Based on a series of technical papers and crosswalks that provide detailed analyses on how the occupation coding scheme for each census year differed from the scheme used in the previous census year, the IPUMS staff traced the proportion of each occupation as it broke down into more specific occupations or as it was combined with others into a more aggregated occupation.

The IHIS followed procedures established by IPUMS-USA staff to create a version of the occupation codes that is comparable, to the extent possible, to the 1995 revised SOC that was used in NHIS surveys from 1995 to 2003. However, the IHIS staff was not able to follow the exact procedures employed by IPUMS-USA staff because the NHIS has released far less detail on occupation codes on the public use files than the Census or American Community Survey. For example, in the 2004 sample, the NHIS occupation code "59" (Communications equipment operators) combined multiple occupational classifications that were distinct in the Census occupational classifications, including code "5010" for switchboard operators, code "5020" for telephone operators, and code "5030" for all other communications equipment operators.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[IND1995 is a modified version of the 1995 revised Standard Industrial Classification-based codes (SIC), offering researchers a consistent long-term classification of industries from 1969 to present. All original industry codes are available in IND. For more information on all of the industrial schemes that were used in previous NHIS surveys, please refer to the "User Note on Occupation and Industry Variables" [URL omitted from DDI.]. Please see the "Universe" tab for more detailed information on changes in the universe across survey samples.

Industry coding in NHIS surveys underwent its two biggest changes in 1983 when the NHIS switched from using the 1967 SIC to the 1972 SIC, and in 2004 after the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was released. The introduction of the 1972 SIC and the 2002 NAICS contributed to significant discontinuities in industry coding in the NHIS history. The IPUMS NHIS staff chose the 1995 revised SIC as the standard because it falls in-between the years when the 1972 SIC and the 2002 NAICS were implemented in the NHIS.

The construction of IND1995 is based on the work done by the IPUMS-USA [URL omitted from DDI.] project, which harmonized Census Bureau industry classifications from 1950 to present, using the 1990 Census Bureau industry classification scheme as a standard. Based on a series of technical papers and crosswalks that provide detailed analyses on how the industry coding scheme for each census year differed from the scheme used in the previous census year, the IPUMS staff traced the proportion of each industry as it broke down into more specific industries or as it was combined with others into a more aggregated industry.

The IHIS followed procedures established by IPUMS-USA staff to create a version of the industry codes that is comparable, to the extent possible, to the 1995 revised SIC that was used in NHIS surveys from 1995 to 2003. However, IHIS staff were not able to follow the exact procedures employed by IPUMS-USA staff because the NHIS released far less detail on industry codes on the public use files than the Census or American Community Survey. For example, in the 2010 sample, the NHIS industry code "71" (amusement, gambling, and recreation industries) combined multiple industries that were distinct in the Census, including code "8580" (bowling centers) and code "8590" (other amusement, gambling, and recreation centers).]]></txt>

      <labl>Employment status including imputation 1</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTATIMP1 is a variable that includes imputed values to replace missing data for the original variable EMPSTAT (employment status).  While the original EMPSTAT variable provides considerable detail about an individual's labor force status (distinguishing, for example, between those who were working for pay, those who were working without pay, and those who were temporarily absent from a job or business), EMPSTATIMP1 is a simple dichotomous variable distinguishing between adults who were "employed" and adults who were "not employed."  The complementary imputation flag variable IMPEMPSFLAG1 indicates whether values in EMPSTATIMP1 were reported or imputed.

Defining Employed versus Not Employed

In EMPSTATIMP1, for 1997-2000, persons were categorized as "employed" (IPUMS NHIS code 1) under three circumstances: a) they reported working at a job or business last week; or b) they did not report working last week but did report working for pay in the last year; or c) they did not report their labor force status but were imputed the value "employed."  Conversely, for 1997-2000, persons were categorized as "not employed" (IHIS code 2) under three circumstances: a) they reported that they did not work at a job or business last week; or b) they reported that they did not work for pay in the last year; or c) they did not report their labor force status but were imputed the value "not employed."  

For 2001 forward, EMPSTATIMP1 maintains the same dichotomous distinction between "employed" and "not employed," but the system for assigning that status was simplified.  Beginning in 2001, persons were categorized as "employed" (IHIS code 1) under two circumstances: a) they reported working for pay in the last year; or b) they did not answer the question about working for pay in the past year and were imputed the value "employed."  Conversely, for 2001 forward, persons were categorized as "not employed" (IHIS code 2) under two circumstances: a) they reported that they did not work for pay in the past year; or b) they did not answer that question but were imputed the value "not employed."

  
Use in Imputed Data on Family Income

EMPSTATIMP1 is the first of five EMPSTATIMP variables that contain imputed values for dichotomous employment status.  It was created as part of a set of variables that provide complete (i.e., without missing values) data on family income. 

One of the purposes of NHIS data is to study relationships between income and health and to monitor health and health care for persons at different income levels.  However, as the technical documentation on "Multiple Imputation of Family Income and Personal Earnings in the National Health Interview Survey: Methods and Examples" [URL omitted from DDI.] describes, non-response rates are high for questions on total family income in the previous calendar year and personal earnings from employment in the previous calendar year.  

To obtain estimates of family income and personal earnings for all survey participants, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) created variables with values imputed for missing data for 1997 forward, using multiple-imputation methodology.  The NHIS public use files with multiply imputed data constitute five files (and thus five versions of variables containing imputed values for missing data), one for each set of imputed values, to allow the assessment of variability due to imputation.  For each person, each file contains family income values, personal earnings values, dichotomous employment status, and the ratio of family income to the poverty line. Complementary flag variables indicate whether, for each individual, the value of each variable was reported or imputed.   For a more detailed description of the imputation process, see IMPEMPSFLAG1.


Further Information on Using Imputed Income Variables

Before using the imputed income and earnings variables, researchers are strongly advised to read the NCHS documentation on imputed income, such as 2008 Imputed Family/Personal Earnings Files [URL omitted from DDI.].  This documentation cautions that each of the five datasets must be merged with other data from the survey to form a single completed dataset.  For IHIS data users, the imputed income files have already been merged with other data from each survey year for 1997-2008, as part of the process of adding these imputed income files and variables to the IHIS database.  
 
The NCHS documentation for the imputed income files further directs that analysis of the five versions of each imputed income variable should be done separately, using methods and software that are appropriate for such survey data (for example, SAS-callable SUDAAN or SAS-callable IVEware).  Only then can estimates and standard errors be combined using the combining rules described in the aforementioned document on "Multiple Imputation of Family Income and Personal Earnings in the National Health Interview Survey."  The 2008 imputed income file documentation further warns:

The extra variability due to imputation CANNOT be incorporated by simply analyzing a SINGLE completed data set as if the imputed values were true values. Moreover, analysts SHOULD NOT create a single competed data set using the AVERAGE of the five sets of imputed values. 

Examples of correct data analyses and additional information about the procedures used to create the imputed data are provided in the technical documentation referred to above.

      <txt><![CDATA[INCIMPPOINT1 is a variable that includes imputed values to replace missing data for the original variable  INCFAM07ON, the total combined family income (from all sources) in the previous calendar year. The complementary imputation flag variable IMPYFAMFLAG1 indicates whether responses in INCIMPPOINT1 were reported or imputed.  

Beginning in 2009, the NHIS has provided imputed income files that contain income dollar amount point estimates rather than income dollar groups.  Because respondent confidentiality must be balanced against providing more detailed information, the variables containing the dollar amounts for personal earnings and family income have been top-coded to the 95th percentile of the distribution.

      <txt><![CDATA[ERYRNO reports the number of times respondents had gone to a hospital emergency room about their own health during the past 12 months, including emergency room visits that resulted in a hospital admission. Respondents were handed a card listing a range of responses and were asked to indicate the appropriate response.

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward cautioned interviewers, "When recording emergency room visits, do not include visits to outpatient clinics and urgent care facilities." The Manual also defined "hospital emergency room" as "an emergency care facility at a hospital. It is also sometimes referred to as an emergency department" and reiterated, "Do not include emergency care received at a clinic or HMO." Emergency room visits that resulted in admission for inpatient care were to be included. The definition of an emergency room and these qualifications were not routinely shared with respondents, however.]]></txt>

      <labl>Total number of surgeries in past 12 months</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults and sample children who had surgery during the past 12 months (SURGERYR), SURGERYRNO reports the number of surgeries (either inpatient or outpatient) individuals had during that time period.  Interviewers asked, "Including any time you may have already told be about, how many different times [have you/has sample adult/sample child] had surgery during the past 12 months?"

The 1997-1998 Field Representative's Manuals instructed interviewers to include as surgery "both major surgery and minor procedures such as setting bones or removing growths."

The Manuals for 1999 forward provided the following definition for surgery:

Surgery is any cutting of the skin, including stitching of cuts or wounds. Include both major surgery and minor procedures such as cutting or piercing of other tissue, scraping of internal parts of the body, and setting of fractures and dislocations.

These definitions were not routinely shared with respondents. Indeed, the NHIS Codebooks for sample adults for 1999 forward acknowledge, "The data in this field may represent an undercount because the respondents may not have included all types of minor surgical procedures, such as setting bones or removal of growths, in their response."  (See comparability section for further discussion.)

In 1997-2017, for sample children who had inpatient or outpatient surgery during the past 12 months (SURGERYR), information was collected on the number of outpatient surgeries they had during the past year (see SURGRYROUTNO).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[VISITYRNO identifies the total number of office visits during the past 12 months. VISITYRNO reports the responses to the survey question, "During the past 12 months, how many times [have/has] [you/sample child] seen a doctor or other health care professional about [your own/sample child's] health at a doctor's office, a clinic, or some other place?" 

From 1997 to 1999, the survey interviewer specifically instructed the interviewee to exclude overnight hospitalizations, visits to hospital emergency rooms, home visits, or telephone calls. For sample adults for 2000 forward, the instructions were expanded to also exclude dental visits.   Dental visits were excluded for sample children for 2002 forward. 

DOCVIS2W reports if the respondent visited a doctor's office during the two weeks prior to the interview, and DOCVIS2WNO reports the number of office visits during the past two weeks.]]></txt>

      <labl>Medical care delayed due to cost, past 12 months</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[DELAYCOST indicates whether, during the past twelve months, individuals delayed seeking medical care because of worry about the cost.  For 1997 forward, respondents were told not to include dental care when answering this question.

 The Field Representative's Manual for 1993 forward noted, "Delayed assumes that medical care has been or will eventually be received."  This definition of the term was not routinely shared with respondents.

Related Variables

Several other variables available for 1997 forward address reasons other than "worry about the cost" that caused sample adults and sample children to delay getting medical care.  The non-financial reasons for delays in getting medical care identified in these variables are:  "you couldn't get an appointment soon enough" (DELAYAPPT); "the clinic/doctor's office wasn't open when you could get there" (DELAYHRS); "you couldn't get through on the telephone" (DELAYPHONE); "you didn't have transportation" (DELAYTRANS); and "once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor" (DELAYWAIT). 

Available for 1997 forward, YBARCARE, which identifies individuals who needed but did not get medical care because they could not afford it during the past 12 months, covers some of the same ground as DELAYCOST.  However, the wording of the question for YBARCARE implies that medical care was foregone for financial reasons, while the wording of the question for DELAYCOST refers to care delayed for financial reasons.  The difference in these two variables may, however, be less than is implied by this semantic distinction.  In the case of some acute illnesses (such as respiratory infections and "stomach flu"), medical care that was delayed was doubtless ultimately foregone in many cases.

The Field Representative's Manual for 1999-2000 instructed interviewers to "include all types of financial limitations that prevented the person from getting medical services."  The Manual for 1997-2003 also included a definition of prescription medicine as "medication which can only be obtained with the approval of a licensed health care professional. The medication is usually obtained through a pharmacy using a written note or telephoned instruction" to the pharmacy from a doctor, dentist, or other health care professional. A similar definition was included in the 2004-2006 Manuals. These points in the documentation were not routinely shared with respondents.

YBARMEDS was one of a series of questions intended to determine if the family's access to health care was restricted because of financial concerns.  The survey also collected information about whether, at any time in the past 12 months, sample adults and sample children needed but did not get eyeglasses (YBARGLASS), mental health care or counseling (YBARMENTAL), dental care, including checkups, (YBARDENTAL), follow-up care (YBARFOLLOW), and specialist care (YBARSPECL).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPRIVATEE indicates whether the person currently had private health insurance coverage. Private health care plans may be provided in part or in full by an individual's employer or union, and they may also be purchased directly by a person.

HIPRIVATEE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and included in the original NHIS public use data. HIPRIVATEE, like other recoded health insurance variables in these data, is based on responses to a series of questions and by editing carried out by the NCHS.

Definitions

The Field Representative's Manual for 1998 defines a private health insurance plan as "any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public programs in categories (4) and (6)-(11)" (of the flash card used by respondents in that year to report their type(s) of insurance coverage). In other words, private health insurance is, in the NCHS, defined as insurance other than Medicare, Medi-Gap, Medicaid, Military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, State-sponsored health plans, and health insurance from other government programs (including CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Plan, which was added to the card in 1999).

The flash card specified distinct kinds of private health insurance coverage in certain years: private health insurance plan from employer or workplace; Medi-Gap (i.e., private health insurance purchased to supplement Medicare), and private insurance plan through a state or local government program or community program. 

This last category, which was first added to the card in 1998, was defined in the Manual for that year as follows:

Private Health Insurance Plan through a State or Local Government program or community Program is a type of private insurance for which state or local government or community effort pays for part or all of the cost of a private insurance plan, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The individual may also contribute the cost of the health insurance and may receive a card such as a Blue Cross/Blue Shield card. A community program or effort may include a variety of mechanisms to achieve health insurance for persons who would otherwise be uninsured. An example would be a private company giving a grant to an HMO to pay health insurance coverage. (Beginning in 1999, the example changed to "a private company providing insurance for 500 uninsured children at little or no cost.")



Single service plans are another type of insurance usually classified as private health insurance, but single service plan coverage did not count as private insurance coverage in HIPRIVATEE. 


Single service insurance was first defined in the 1999 Field Representative's Manual as "health insurance coverage paid for by the individual that provides for only one type of service. Examples of SSPs are dental care, vision care, prescriptions, nursing home care, hospice care, accidents, catastrophic care, cancer treatment, AIDS care, and/or hospitalization."

Initially, the NHIS specifically directed respondents to exclude such private single service plans from their reports of private insurance coverage. In 1997-1998, the flashcard listing general types of insurance coverage and handed to respondents stated, "EXCLUDE private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized or pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, this policy changed. The category "Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions)" was added to the flash card, and the card directed respondents to "INCLUDE those that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care), exclude private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized."

While information on most kinds of single service plans was collected in the survey from 1999 forward, these privately purchased single service health insurance plans were not treated as "private insurance coverage" in HIPRIVATEE.  As the Field Representative's Manual for 2001 forward explained, "In trying to determine the appropriate type of health care coverage that an individual has, it is important to remember that for purposes of this survey, Single Service Plans are not considered private health insurance and should not be recorded as such. For individuals who indicate that they are covered by a Single Service Plan, simply record them as being covered by a single service plan, and the appropriate follow up questions will be asked."


2001 marked the first year that the Field Representative's Manual provided guidance to interviewers on recording responses relating to two other types of private insurance coverage--COBRA and TCC--that were included in HIPRIVATEE (under the subheading, "Private Health Insurance Plan from employer or workplace").

 The Manual's discussion of COBRA and TCC was as follows:

If a respondent indicates that he/she is covered by COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by TTC (Temporary Consolidation of Coverage), this should be coded as a Private Health Insurance Plan from employer or workplace. COBRA provides a bridge between health plans for qualified workers, their spouses and their dependent children when their health insurance might otherwise be cut off. Under this act, if a person voluntarily resigns from a job or is terminated for any reason other than 'gross misconduct' they are guaranteed the right to continue in their former employers group health insurance plan as an individual or family health care coverage for up to 18 months at one's own expense. In some cases, a spouse and dependent children are also eligible for COBRA coverage for as long as three years.

The TCC program is similar to COBRA. This program is available to federal employees. If a person loses Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) coverage because of separation from federal service, they may enroll under the TCC provision of FEHB law to continue coverage for up to 18 months at their own expense in a FEHB plan. Family members who lose coverage because they are no longer eligible may enroll under TCC to continue FEHB coverage for up to 36 months at their own expense.


Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills." In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."

Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

The categories listed were:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)



Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Instructions regarding single service plans changed over time. 

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized." In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."


Follow-up questions were used to collect information about plan names and to verify non-coverage. 

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans. If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.

For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage.


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.

Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, such as HIPRIVATEE, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

Related Variables

In addition to HIPRIVATEE, IPUMS NHIS contains other  recoded insurance variables.

These are: HIHSE (Covered by Indian Health Service: Recode); HIMILITE (Covered by military health insurance: Recode); HIMILITE (Covered by military health insurance: Recode); HIMCAIDE (Covered by Medicaid: Recode); HIMCAREE (Covered by Medicare: Recode); HISTATEE (Covered by other state-sponsored health plan: Recode); HIOTHGOVE (Covered by other government program: Recode); and HINOTCOVE (No coverage of any type: Recode).

Information was collected on up to four plans; users may want to see related variables HIP2TYPE, HIP3TYPE, and HIP4TYPE.  For 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. However, very few individuals have more than 2 private insurance plans. Persons with more than two plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward).

Data Editing and Recoding
For 1997 forward, the NCHS edited responses as to what type of insurance coverage persons had based on plan names. The frequencies provided in HIP1TYPE reflect responses that have been verified though editing based on plan names. A full description of the editing process and the definition of private insurance is provided under the variable description for HIPRIVATEE.

To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1TYPE, someone may have mistakenly reported having private insurance when in fact they in did not. These individuals are not included in the frequencies reported in HIP1TYPE.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who were covered by a private insurance plan that was paid for by the person or a family member living in the household, ("2" for HIP1SELF), this variable indicates the amount spent for insurance premiums, including payroll deductions. Respondents provided the amount in dollars spent on premiums (as a continuous measure) and the time period (month, week, etc). The IPUMS NHIS recode for HIP1COST also indicates whether the amount reported was more than $20,000 dollars (code "20000").

For 1999 to 2001, interviewers asked respondents for the amount paid on premiums in the past 12 months (e.g., "During the PAST 12 MONTHS, how much did {you/your family} spend for health insurance premiums for {plan name}?"). For 2002 forward, respondents were asked how much they (or their family} currently spend for health insurance premiums for each plan and could then specify the time period for the expenditure (e.g., once a week, a month or yearly). For 2002, responses were recoded to indicate annual expenditure.

In general, the definition and measurement of private health insurance for 1999 forward remained consistent. Single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents were not considered private insurance. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the change in measurement of private insurance over time.

Data Editing and Recoding
For 1997 forward, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The responses for HIP1COST reflect editing by NCHS to ensure that respondents do have private insurance. A full description of the editing process and changes in definition is provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE.]]></txt>

      <labl>Plan 1: Doctor from preferred list</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For persons with at least one private health insurance plan for which they can choose any doctor ( HIP1MDPIC = 1), HIP1MDLIS indicates if the plan provides the option of choosing a doctor from a preferred or select list at a lower cost. For all years, persons with single service insurance plans (such as those which paid only for accidents) were not asked this question.

For 1993-1996, details about the characteristics of insurance plans (such as HIP1MDLIS) reflect plans for any family member in the household. In order to determine if the person (rather than someone else in the family) was covered by this plan, analysts should use the variable HI1PCOV (Health Insurance Plan 1: Person's Coverage Status), which indicates whether the person was covered by the plan.


Thus, information about whether the person had private insurance that was currently carried through an employer or union may appear in multiple variables: HI1EMP, through HI4EMP.  Likewise, the complementary variables HI1PCOV through  HI4PCOV indicate coverage status for the individual under each plan.


Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available.


Users may also want to see HIP2MDLIS, HIP3MDLIS and HIP4MDLIS. In addition, the IPUMS NHIS created the variable HIPMDLISR, which indicates whether the person had any plan that provided a preferred list of doctors at a lower cost.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). Very few persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center.


Data Editing and Recoding

For 1997 forward, responses for respondents who mistakenly indicated their private coverage status were edited by the NCHS. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from a list of categories on a card. The frequencies provided in HIP1MDLIS reflect responses in which private insurance was verified though editing on plan names. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons with a private health insurance plan who must select from a group or list of doctors (HIP1MDPIC = "2"), this variable indicates if the plan will pay for any part of the cost if the respondent selects a doctor who is not in the plan. For all years, persons with single service insurance plans (such as those which paid only for accidents) were not asked this question.

For 1993-1996, details about the characteristics of insurance plans (such as HIP1MDOP) reflect plans for any family member in the household. In order to determine if the person (rather than someone else in the family) was covered by this plan, analysts should use the variable HI1PCOV (Health Insurance Plan 1: Person's Coverage Status), which indicates whether the person was covered by the plan.


Thus, information about whether the person had private insurance that was currently carried through an employer or union may appear in multiple variables: HI1EMP, through HI4EMP.  Likewise, the complementary variables HI1PCOV through  HI4PCOV indicate coverage status for the individual under each plan.


Data Editing and Recoding

For 1997 forward, responses for respondents who mistakenly indicated their private coverage status were edited by the NCHS. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from a list of categories on a card. The frequencies provided in HIP1MDOP reflect responses in which private insurance was verified though editing on plan names. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. Users may also want to see HIP2MDOP , HIP3MDOP  and HIP4MDOP. 

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward).  Very few persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center.


In addition, the IPUMS NHIS created the variable HIPMDOPR, which indicates if the person had any plan that will pay for any part of the cost of a doctor who is not in the plan's preferred list of providers.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons with at least one private health insurance plan, HIP1RXCOV indicates whether the first private plan paid for any of the costs for medicines prescribed by the doctor. If necessary, interviewers asked respondents, "Does this plan have a drug benefit?"

Information was collected on up four plans per family; however data are only publicly available for plans one and two. Users may want to see HIP2RXCOV and the IPUMS NHIS recoded variable HIPRXCOVR, which indicates whether either plan covered prescription drugs.

 Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). A very small number of persons have more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center. See the Survey Description document available on the NCHS website for more information.


Definitions

For the years in which HIP1RXCOV is available, the definition of "private health insurance" remained the same. For all years, respondents who answered the question for HIP1RXCOV had private health insurance, defined as any type of health insurance  excluding  single service plans, or plans that paid for only type of service. From 2001 forward, COBRA and TCC were specifically included as private health insurance. 

Data Editing and Recoding

HIP1RXCOV is part of a series of follow-up questions for individuals who indicated they had private health insurance. The frequencies provided in HIP1RXCOV reflect responses which have been edited based on plan names. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the editing process.


Not all persons were accurate in reporting what type of health insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the type of insurance coverage the person selected (when handed a card listing various types) and the verbatim name of the insurance plan. For this reason, the NCHS edited the responses to reassign persons to the correct type of insurance coverage. ]]></txt>

Plans with deductibles greater than $1,100 for a single person or greater than $2,200 for two or more persons are considered high deductible plans. 

If the person mentioned a separate deductible for prescription drugs, hospitalization, or out-of-network care, interviewers instructed them not to include those deductible amounts in the total.

Related variables 

The IPUMS NHIS has also created the variable HIPEMPAYR, available for 1989 forward for years in which survey data is available, which indicates whether the respondent had any private plan paid for by the employer.

Please use the IHIS drop down menu and search functions for other related variables.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. Users may also want to see the related variables HIP2EMP, HIP3EMP, and HIP4EMP. 

 Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). Very few people (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) have more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center. See the 2004 Survey Description document available on the NHIS website for more information.


For all years, HIP1EMP is available, the definition of private insurance coverage remained relatively consistent and excluded single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents. However, the definition, order, and wording of private health insurance changed over time.  Users are strongly encouraged to review the user note Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.].

Data Editing and Recoding

For 1997 forward, HIP1EMP reflects responses that have been edited by the NCHS based on plan name. Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1EMP.  A full description of the editing process and changes in definition is provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the "more" link below.


To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables, which are edited to correct for respondents mistakes of insurance information. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who indicated they have a private insurance plan, this variable indicates whether the first plan was paid for by the person or a family member (living in the household). The text "living in the household" was added to the survey for 2004; for 1997- 2003, the text read "Self or Family." If the respondent was self-employed and obtained coverage through self-employment or professional associations, then they would report coverage under  HIP1EMP, employer-sponsored private coverage obtained through the workplace.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. Users may also want to see the related variables HIP2SELF, HIP3SELF, and HIP4SELF . The IPUMS NHIS has also created the variable HIPBUYOWNR, available for 1976 forward for years in which survey data is available, which indicates whether the respondent had any private plan purchased directly.

 Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). A very small number of persons have more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center.


Users should note that the definition and measurement of private health insurance changed over time. For all years HIP1SELF is available, the definition remained consistent. Private insurance generally referred to any type of insurance other than the public programs asked about in the survey, and excluded single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents. Users can review the user note, "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance" when comparing surveys from before and after 1997.

Data Editing and Recoding

The frequencies provided in HIP1SELF reflect responses that have been edited based on the plan name by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1SELF. A full description of the editing process used by the NCHS and changes in definition are provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the "more" link below.

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1SELF, someone may have mistakenly reported having private insurance when in fact they in did not. These individuals are not included in the frequencies reported in HIP1SELF.

The Field Representative's Manual for 2001 forward defined arthritis as "an inflammation of one or more joints of the body, usually producing pain, redness, and stiffness."

Related Variables

The NHIS Survey Description for 2002 noted that the question for ARTHLIMIT was a "new core question" on joint symptoms and arthritis. Several other questions on arthritis were fielded periodically, including inquiries in 2002, 2003, and 2006 for:

ARTHCLASS (Ever take class to help arthritis)
ARTHEXERCISE (Ever told to exercise to help arthritis)
ARTHWEIGHT (Ever told to lose weight to help arthritis)

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Bladder</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNBLAD identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had bladder cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  For 1997 forward, the Field Representative's Manual directed: "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as bladder cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK)

soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of bladder cancer is reported in CNBLADAG.

      <txt><![CDATA[CNESOP identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had esophageal cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as esophageal cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.

Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form.  If the respondent mentioned no more than three types of cancer, the interviewer marked an "N" for "no more" on the survey form.  If the respondent mentioned four or more types of cancer, the interviewer coded the fourth box on the form "96."  In the latter case, when more than three kinds of cancer were mentioned, CANKIND3 has a value of 2 ("mentioned") in IPUMS NHIS.  If only one, two, or three kinds of cancer were mentioned, CNKIND3 has a value of 1 ("not mentioned") in IHIS.   

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR.

Persons who have a code of 2 ("mentioned") in CNKIND3 should also have a code of 2 ("mentioned") in three of these other variables.  In other words, CNKIND3 does not replace these other variables; it simply provides the supplemental information that the individual had been diagnosed with an additional form or forms of cancer which the survey form did not have room to record.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Liver</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNLIVR identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had liver cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as liver cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM)

soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of liver cancer is reported in CNLIVRAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Pancreatic</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNPANC identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had pancreatic cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)

soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is reported in CNPANCAG.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as stomach cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of stomach cancer is reported in CNSTOMAG.

Persons who reported their diagnosis as "borderline" diabetes were not asked this follow-up question. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe for a specific age but to "record a best estimate if that is what the sample adult gives you."

The 2006 Codebook for the NHIS public use data files contains the following warning about inaccuracies in this variable:

These data have not been edited for reasonableness. Some respondents appear to give information on how long ago the condition was first diagnosed rather than their age when the condition was first diagnosed.

Other diabetes-related questions were periodically included in the survey; see DIABETICEV for a summary of these variables currently in the IPUMS NHIS.]]></txt>

      <labl>Cigarette smoking recode 2: Current detailed/former/never</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults 18 and over, this is a recoded variable indicating the respondent's current smoking status in categories of current smoker, every day current smoker, some day current smoker, current smoker--unknown frequency of smoking, and also indicates former smoker, never smoked and "has smoked, current smoking status unknown."


In this variable, current smokers were divided into "every day" smokers or "some days" smokers.  The process to classify respondents into these categories changed slightly between 1991 and 1992 forward.  In 1991, ever smokers were asked if they smoke now; respondents who said "yes" were asked if they smoked "every day" or "some days.  Respondents who answered "no" were asked, "Do you smoke some days or not at all?" This additional follow-up resulted in the classification of persons as "someday smokers" who would otherwise have been considered former smokers, since they initially said that they did not smoke now. 

In 1992, questions on smoking status were included in two sections of the survey; in the  Cancer Control section, the same three questions  from in the 1991 questionnaire were used;  in the Cancer Epidemiology section, just two questions were used: "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes during your entire life?" If yes, "Do you NOW smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?" Use of both sets of questions allowed for estimation of the impact of the question change on population prevalence. The revised current smoking status question was estimated to have resulted in an increase in smoking prevalence of about 1 percent-- a result occurring mainly from capturing smoking among persons who would otherwise have been classified as nonsmokers with the original question.

This version of the question was used from 1992 forward.


Related Variables

Other recoded smoking status variables are included in the NHIS.


These include:
 
SMOKESTATUS1    "never," "current," "former," "former regular smoker," "former occasional smoker," "unknown," and unknown if ever smoked 100 cigarettes," and "smoked 100 cigarettes, unknown if currently smoke." 
SMOKESTATUS3  categorizes respondents into current every day smoker, current some day smoker ((1 or more days, past month),  current some day smoker  (0 days, past month), current some day smoker (unknown days in past month) and also indicates former smoker, never smoked and "has smoked, current smoking status unknown."
